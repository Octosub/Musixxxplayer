# Musixxxplayer 
This code is written in the context of an excercise in the book "Hacking und Cybersecurity mit KI" from Florian Dalwigk.
The goal of this excercise is to create a musicplayer with Python by letting only ChatGPT generate the whole code. 
The purpose of this excercise is to learn how to formulate prompts precisely so you can get ChatGPT to generate the code exactly how you intend to.
